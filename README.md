# FPGA_CALCULATOR_PROJECT
4th semester chip desgin vhdl project


Folder "impl": Contains the created Xilinx Vivado Project with constraint files, timing wizards etc. for the FPGA board.

Folder "msim": All simulation .do files for the circuit simulation in Intel Modelsim

Folder "tb": Contains all testbench files for the entities and architectures

Folder "vhdl": Contains all VHDL code for all elements in this projects.

To simulate the entities, start Intel Modelsim and navigate into the "msim" folder (absolute path), then call the simulation files with the "do" command.

For example: "do sim_alu.do", which starts the simulation of the ALU calculator component.
